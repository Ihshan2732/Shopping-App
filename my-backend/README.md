It sounds like you may be facing connectivity issues with your MongoDB server. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

1. **Server Not Running:** Ensure that the MongoDB server is running on your laptop. You can verify this by running `mongod` in your terminal.

2. **Configuration Issues:** Check that the connection string and configuration settings (host, port, authentication) in your application are correct.

3. **Firewall or Security Settings:** Make sure your firewall or security software is not blocking MongoDB connections. You might need to adjust your settings or add an exception.

4. **Database Server Down:** If you are connecting to a remote MongoDB server, it might be down or experiencing issues. Contact your database provider or administrator to check the server status.

5. **Driver Issues:** Ensure that the MongoDB driver you are using is properly installed and up-to-date. If the driver is not compatible with your laptop or environment, you may need to update or replace it.
